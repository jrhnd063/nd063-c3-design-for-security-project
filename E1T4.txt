The instance profile role assigned to the `RecipeWebServiceInstance` EC2 instance allows principals with the role to perform an action to any S3 bucket or object stored in an S3 bucket, rather than just exposing the ability to read data from the free recipes bucket, which is the only action the application's current features support and should therefore be applied as the "least privilege" permissions required by the role.

The security group assigned to the `RecipeWebServiceInstance` allows all incoming traffic, from any port or IP address, including access to SSH on port 22. Flask is also open to the world on port 5000, when it only needs to receive requests on that port from internal traffic in the trusted public subnet.
