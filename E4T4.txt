In addition to closing SSH access and making the Web server an immutable AMI, the app can be placed behind a Web Application Firewall.

"Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket."

No, a private VPC Endpoint would not stop the class of attack we have been simulating, because this attack was coming from within the same VPC. It would however prevent another class of attack in which the leaked credentials were used to access the bucket from elsewhere, such as directly over the Internet.
